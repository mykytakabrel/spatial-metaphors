# spatial-metaphors

The repository contains 8 CSV files, and two ipynb files with the code. Each file represents the dataset that was used for data analysis in the study. To run the code, you need to download each file and then run a code on your PC through an application applicable to Python e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Please don't forget to change the file path in the code before running it. 
P.S. - in the file names, "80" means the datasets with impartial categorization (at least 80% of agreement among participants), while "- 3" refers to the datasets where we excluded the top 3 metaphors.
